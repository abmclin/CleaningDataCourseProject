Study Design:

The run_analysis tidy data set is generated from UCI Machine Learning Repository's Human Activity
Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The training and test data sets denoted X_train and X_test in the UCI data set were merged together
with their features labels which are provided by the UCI repository.

Further processing was done to associate each measurement with the subject and activity which
generated the original measurements.

run_analysis then extracts all the mean and std measurements from the original data set for each
subject and activity, then averages all of them to produce the final value that is outputted in
the tidy data set.

The mean and std measurements can be classified into Time measurements and FrequencyDomain measurements where Fast Fourier Transform was taken of the sampled signals to produce the Frequency Domain measurements.

Tri-axial and angular measurements were taken, so you will see X, Y, Z, and Gyro measurements in the
data set.

The Jerk and Magnitude values were also derived from the tri-axial and angular acceleration measurements.

We also provide the angle measurements that have been calculated for between various mean measurements and other parameters in case they are of interest for additional analysis.

Please refer to features.txt in the UCI HAR data set for a list of the original measurements' names.
